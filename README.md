# VSMac-ClassDiagram (WIPâš’)

A Visual Studio for Mac extension that creates a visual graph of classes and their dependencies within your loaded projects.

Additionally, classes can be grouped together into user-created groups which is also displayed in the visual graph. For example, classes could be grouped as belonging to a "Model", "View" and "Controller" groups.
